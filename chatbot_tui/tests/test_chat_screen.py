# Unit tests for ChatScreen functionalities

# Test Ideas for Tool Progress Display:
# 1. Mock the `AsyncOpenAI` client and `tools.smart_tool_call`.
# 2. When a chat completion response includes tool calls:
#    a. Verify that for each tool call, a "tool_status" message is mounted to the `VerticalScroll(id="messages")`.
#       - Check the message content (e.g., "Executing tool: <tool_name>...").
#       - Check the message role ("tool_status").
#    b. Verify that `messages.scroll_end()` is called after mounting status messages.
#    c. After the (mocked) `tools.smart_tool_call` completes:
#       - Verify that all previously added "tool_status" messages are removed from the `VerticalScroll`.
#    d. (Optional) If possible, check the order: user message, assistant reply (partial), tool status, tool result.

# Test Ideas for Model Selector:
# 1. Test `ChatScreen.compose()`:
#    a. Verify that a `Select` widget with `id="model_selector"` is present.
#    b. Verify that the `Select` widget is populated with the `MODEL_OPTIONS` defined in `ChatScreen`.
#    c. Verify that the `Select` widget has the `DEFAULT_MODEL` set as its initial value.
#
# 2. Test `ChatScreen.complete()` model usage:
#    a. Mock the `AsyncOpenAI` client.
#    b. Simulate selecting a different model using the `Select` widget.
#       - This might involve getting the `Select` widget instance from the screen,
#         setting its `value` property, and then calling `complete()`.
#    c. Verify that the `client.chat.completions.create` method is called with the `model` parameter matching the
#       model selected in the `Select` widget.
#    d. Verify that if `model_selector.value` is `None`, the `DEFAULT_MODEL` is used in the API call.

# Note on Textual Testing:
# Textual provides a test harness (`App.run_test()`) that can be used for more integrated tests.
# For example, to simulate widget interactions or check screen composition.
# These test ideas are conceptual and would need to be implemented using appropriate
# mocking libraries (like `unittest.mock`) and Textual's testing utilities.
